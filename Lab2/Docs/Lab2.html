        <p>
            This lab explores writing static methods versus instance methods in Java.  Both are useful ways to get something done (a computation), but as we develop more complex code, there are lots of reasons to strongly associate a computation with a specific instance of an object (associate data and computation together in one object).

        <div class="header">
            <h2>Objectives</h2>
        </div>

        <ul>
            <li>To be able to write static methods that can compute the perimeter of three different types of geometric shapes (Circle, Rectangle and Polygon)(part 1)
            <li>To be able to write instance methods to compute the perimeter of three different types of geometric shapes (part 2)
            <li>To be able to write a static method to compare the perimeters of different objects (part 1 & 2)
            <li>To be able to write your own test cases to create geometric shapes and test the computation of their perimeter, and the computation of comparison of their sizes (measured as perimeter) (part 1 & 2)
        </ul>

        </div>

        <p>
            In the provided <code>part1</code> subdirectory, implement the following
            classes with these general requirements:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Each instance variable must be <code>private</code>.</p></li>
            <li><p>Provide the appropriate "accessor"/"getter" methods for the
                instance variables. (see PartOneTestCases.java for names)</p></li>
            <li><p>You may add methods beyond those required, but any such
                additional method must be <code>private</code>.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <span class="warning">Automaton Warning:</span>  You are an intelligent
            person; you should not just mechanically apply these rules only to satisfy
            a style checker in order to complete the lab.  Instead, consider the
            reasons for these rules, what violating them exposes to the user/client
            of the corresponding class, and what following them guarantees to you,
            the implementer. If you aren't sure, ask your neighbor, they might have
            thoughts of their own.
        </p>

        <div class="header">
            <h3>Classes</h3>
        </div>

        <p>
            The following assumes your two-dimensional <code>Point</code> implementation
            from the previous lab.  Copy your <code>Point.java</code> into the working
            directory.
        </p>

        <p>Implement these classes.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p><code>Circle.java</code> represents a circle given a
                <code>Point</code> center and a <code>double</code> radius.</p></li>
            <li><p><code>Rectangle.java</code> represents an axis-aligned rectangle
                given a <code>Point</code> top-left and a <code>Point</code>
                bottom-right.</p></li>
            <li><p><code>Polygon.java</code> represents a polygon given
                <code>List&lt;Point&gt;</code> points.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <b>Note that as your implementation will be tested with PartOneTestCases,
                you may want to read exactly what the expected "get" method names are!</b>
        </p>

        <div class="header">
            <h3>Overloaded Method</h3>
        </div>

        <p>
            Define a <code>Util</code> class with three <code>static</code>
            <code>perimeter</code> methods.  Each such method takes, as its single
            parameter, one of the classes defined in the previous step (i.e., there
            is one <code>perimeter</code> method that takes a <code>Circle</code>,
            one <code>perimeter</code> method that takes a <code>Polygon</code>,
            etc.) and returns the perimeter of the object (as a <code>double</code>).
        </p>

        <p>
            You can assume for now that all constructors will create correct closed
            shapes.
        </p>

        <p>
            A method (or methods) like <code>perimeter</code> is considered overloaded
            since there is a separate definition for different parameter types.  This
            is also referred to as ad-hoc polymorphism because the (theoretically)
            <em>single</em> method is effectively defined to work with a small set of
            parameter types, not for all parameter types (i.e., the method takes "many
            forms", but only very specific forms are supported).  You will likely hear
            "overloaded" much more often, but "ad-hoc polymorphism" sounds so much
            cooler (though, admittedly, it is a bit more intimidating).
        </p>

        <p>
            Note that to call a static method like these, you can invoke:
            <code>
                Util.perimeter(new Circle(new Point(0, 0), 1.0));
            </code>
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="warning">Deeper Understanding:</span> How does the Java
            implementation know which version of <code>perimeter </code> to use when the
            method is invoked (not-so-great hint at this point, the compiler determines
            the implementation under this scenario)?  If the answer is not apparent, then
            think about the different method invocations and speak with those around you.
            If the answer seems obvious, then hold on to that belief for the next few weeks
            to see if it continues to hold.
        </p>

        <div class="header">
            <h3>Methods in Action</h3>
        </div>

        <p>
            Define a <code>Bigger</code> class with one
            <code>static whichIsBigger</code> method.  This helper method will take
            three parameters a <code>Circle, Rectangle, and Polygon</code> and will
            return a <code>double</code> representing the largest perimeter of the
            three objects. You will use this method to determine which is the largest
            between:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li> a cirle centered at {1.0, 1.0} with radius of 2.0
            <li> a rectangle with the corners {-1.0, 2.0} and {1.0, -1.6}
            <li> a polygon defined by {0, 0}, {3, 1}, {1, 4}, and {-1, 4}
        </ol>

        <p>
            You may want to test your perimeter computations first (see next section).
        </p>

        <div class="header">
            <h3>Tests</h3>
        </div>

        <p>Yes, of course you will want to test all of these operations.  Add your
            tests to the provided <code>PartOneTestCases.java</code> file.</p>

        <p>
            You are expected to write at least one test case for each perimeter and one
            test case for whichIsBigger.
            <b>That means you must demo at least 8 tests (as there are some already there for implementation details).</b>
        </p>

        <p>
            Helper: here is an example of testing the perimeter for a polygon:<br>

        <PRE>
   @Test
   public void testPerimPoly() {
        List &lt; Point &gt;points = new ArrayList &lt; Point &gt;();
        points.add(new Point(0, 0));
        points.add(new Point(3,0));
        points.add(new Point(0,4));
        double d = Util.perimeter(new Polygon(points));
        assertEquals(12.0, d, DELTA);
   }<br>
</PRE>

        <div class="header">
            <h2>Part 2: Methods</h2>
        </div>

        <p>Copy your files from <code>part1</code> into <code>part2</code> (you
            will not need the test cases file from part 1).</p>

        <p>The definition of <code>perimeter</code> in the first part of this
            lab does not follow an object-oriented style.  This part of the lab
            asks that you make a few modifications to improve the code (further
            such improvements can come with later material).
            <i>Don't worry this part will be easier!</i>
        </p>

        <p>
            From <code>Util.java</code>, move each <code>perimeter</code> method
            into the appropriate class (as a non-<code>static</code> method, i.e.,
            instance method) corresponding to <code>perimeter</code>'s parameter.
            The goal is that each object "knows how" to compute its own perimeter.
            As such, <code>perimeter</code> will no longer need to take a parameter
            (it acts on <code>this</code> which refers to ... well, there is no
            universally accepted term for the target of <code>this</code> because
            computer scientists are not very good at naming things or at agreeing
            on the meaning of names/terms; you might hear "calling object", "current
            object", "context object", "target", "callee", "referent", "object on which
            the method was invoked" (that last one is real, and accurate, but is a sign
            of giving up on naming)). (You can remove <code>Util.java</code> once
            this is done).
        </p>

        <p>
            Be sure to also copy over the <code>Bigger</code> class and revise it to
            use your new instance methods.
            <i>Take a moment... do you like one style over the other?</i>
        </p>

        <div class="header">
            <h3>Tests</h3>
        </div>

        <p>Add tests to the provided <code>PartTwoTestCases.java</code> file.
            This is where you will also be able to see the changes of having the methods defined within each class (instance methods) versus the static methods this
            lab started with.
            <b>Again, there should be an added test for each of the types of perimeters
                and a test of whichIsBigger (can you challenge your neighbor with new perimeters?)</b>

            <i>Again, reflect, do you like one style over the other?</i>
        </p>
